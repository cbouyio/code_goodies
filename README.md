A set of python scripts and modules for (mostly) typical everyday chores developed in UEA, TSL, iSSB and Paris Diderot - Paris VII (now Universit√© de Paris).
Since 2007.

## biopython_CAI.py
Script to calculate the Codon Adaptation Index of sequences (contains the human codon usage tables)

## fastaMetrics.py
Script to calculate and print in a pretty format a series of usefull metrics out of a sequnece file. (can be imported as a module too!)

## generateReportLines.py
A small script to generate reports from the chromatine fiber polymer simulation outputs.

## interactionSitesGenerator
A small script to generate typical and toy input files of arbitrary complexity for the interaction sites for the chromatine fiber polymer simulations.

## local_score.py
A simple implementation of the local score algorithm.

## selectExpressedTranscripts
A script to select the most expressed transcript.

## select_largest_element_fasta.py
A script to select the longest genomic element (like a UTR, coding
region etc.) from the same gene out of a multi fasta file.
