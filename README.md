Code Goodies
=============

A set of R scripts and python scripts and modules for (mostly) typical code chores developed in UEA, TSL, iSSB and Paris Diderot - Paris VII (Université de Paris now Université Paris Cité).
Since 2007.

#### biopython_CAI.py
Script to calculate the Codon Adaptation Index of sequences (contains the human codon usage tables)

#### fastaMetrics.py
Script to calculate and print in a pretty format a series of usefull metrics out of a sequnece file. (can be imported as a module too!)

#### generateReportLines.py
A small script to generate reports from the chromatine fiber polymer simulation outputs.

#### interactionSitesGenerator
A small script to generate typical and toy input files of arbitrary complexity for the interaction sites for the chromatine fiber polymer simulations.

#### local_score.py
A simple implementation of the local score algorithm.

#### rGoodies_DiffEnrichClustAnal_functions
An R functions library containing everyday usefull functions for RNA-seq analysis.

#### selectExpressedTranscripts
A script to select the most expressed transcript.

#### select_largest_element_fasta.py
A script to select the longest genomic element (like a UTR, coding
region etc.) from the same gene out of a multi fasta file.
